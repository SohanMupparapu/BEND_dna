This script is used to precompute the embeddings for a task.
In the following step, the embeddings will be used to train a model.

This script differs from the default precompute_embeddings.py script in that it
computes embeddings for two sequences: the reference sequence and the variant
sequence. The variant sequence is obtained by replacing the reference nucleotide
with the variant nucleotide at the variant position.
